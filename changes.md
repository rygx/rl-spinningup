# Changes in the fork

### Installation

Solutions to compile and link errors:

```
conda install mpich-mpicc
conda install swig
```

Deprecation of install:

```
DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of spinup==0.2.0 from file:///home/miko-debian/pydev/rl-spinningup (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.0 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457
